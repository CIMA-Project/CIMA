# CIMA
Chinese Immune Multi-Omics Atlas (CIMA), characterizing molecular variations linked to sex, age, and genetics through multi-omics analysis of > 10 million immune cells from 428 adults. CIMA established an enhancer-driven gene regulatory network comprising 237 robust regulons, identified 9,600 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 52,361 chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) at cell-type resolution, and revealed pleiotropic associations among immune-related disease risk loci, eQTLs, and caQTLs. Furthermore, the novel CIMA-CLM model predicts chromatin accessibility and noncoding variant impacts from chromatin sequences and gene expression.
